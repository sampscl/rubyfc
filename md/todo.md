## TODO
More than I can possibly think of, but a short list:

1. Enable debugging fleets directly rather than via aifc-game or debug-aifc-game
1. Write missions and support infrastructure to enable a single player campaign
1. Write more KOTH-type missions; deathmatch doesn't cut it
1. Implement the ladder system, logins, and the associated web interface
1. Consume zip files instead of single ruby scripts for fleet AI
1. Do something to enforce security
1. Improve this readme so that it's more useful to the uninitiated
